# Wide Angle Analytics meets Next.js

This project is a sample implementation of [Wide Angle Analytics](https://wideangle.co) being deployed to Next.js application. 

This is very crude example, where the site tracking ID is hardcoded in the `WideAngleComponent`. Please consider this for demonstration purposes only.

## Contents

- `src/app/wideangle.js` a sample component enabling Wide Angle Analytics
- `src/app/layout.js` global layout using `WideAngleComponent` enabling tracking site-wide
- `src/app/trackedButton.js` an example application of custom action tracking
